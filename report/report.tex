\chapter{How to use our program}
\input{sections/chapter_1}

Our program is divided in two main modules, the mapping module and the planning module.
The role of the first one is to build the map of the environment of the robot using the echoes of the lasers.
The role of the second one is to plan the path that the robot must follow in order to explore the world.

To communicate with the MRDS server we created a class named 'Robot', it is used as an interface to send and receive informations to and from the MRDS server easily.
The received informations are directly adapted to our needs and stored using our 'Position' and 'Laser' datastructures in this class.
