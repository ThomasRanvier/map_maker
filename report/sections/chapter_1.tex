\section{Code structure}

Our program is divided in three main modules, the mapping module, the planning module and the controller module.
The role of the first one is to build the map of the environment of the robot using the echoes of the lasers.
The role of the second one is to plan the goal of the robot and the path that the robot must follow in order to explore the world.
The role of the controller module is to make the robot move towards its goal while avoiding the obstacles in its way.

To communicate with the MRDS server we created a class named 'Robot', it is used as an interface to send and receive informations to and from the MRDS server easily.
The received informations are directly adapted to our needs and stored using our 'Position' and 'Laser' datastructures in this class.

\section{How to run our program}

For this assignment we used Python 3 as programming language, to run the program you can use the following syntax:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
> python3 main.py
\end{lstlisting}
